- title: Slide family
  desc: |
    The `slide(.x, .f)` functions are similar to `purrr::map(.x, .f)`. Both
    iterate over `.x`, applying `.f` as they go. The difference is that
    `slide()` moves over `.x` in sliding windows, rather than one element at
    a time. The return value size is always the same size as `.x`, and the
    type is defined by the function suffix.

- title: Slide index family
  desc: |
    These functions iterate over `.x` using sliding windows defined with a
    secondary index vector, `.i`. The windows are constructed by "looking back"
    and "looking forward" a certain number of periods from each element of `.i`.
    This is useful for constructing irregular sliding windows, such as sliding
    with a look back period of two months when you have daily data. In that
    example, not all months have the same number of days, and some months might
    be missing data, so a fixed window size wouldn't be useful.

- title: Slide period family
  desc: |
    These functions work by iterating over `.x` in "period blocks", such as
    one month blocks of data. The blocks are defined using a combination of
    a secondary date-like index vector, `.i`, and a period to block by.

  - slide_period

- title: Hop family
  desc: |
    These functions are lower level versions of their `slide()` equivalents.
    They allow you to manually construct the boundaries to slide with, and
    are useful if you need more flexibility than what `slide()` provides.

- title: Block
  desc: |
    `block()` breaks `.x` into its "period blocks". The blocks are defined
    using a combination of a secondary date-like index vector, `.i`, and a
    period to block by. The return value is always a list, and the elements
    of the list are slices of `.x`.
